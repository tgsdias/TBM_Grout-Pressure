# TBM_Grout-Pressure

The objective here is to model the grout flow in 2D around a lining element from tunnel boring machines (TBMs) in soft ground, with particular emphasis on the interaction between the size of the soil-lining gap, the grout pressure distribution, and the convergence/expansion of the tunnel cavity in equilibrium with the grout pressures.

**Requirements**
The FlexPDE software must be installed. This finite element solution environment for partial differential equations has a Free trial version [(PDE Solutions)](http://www.pdesolutions.com) that is suitable for these calculations.
